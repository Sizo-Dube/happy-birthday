      <p>And don't worry, as an Aquarian, you're naturally humanitarian... which means you'll be too busy helping others to notice how old you're getting.</p>
      <p>May your dreams and plans come to fruition, and may God's blessings continue to guide and prosper you.</p>
      <p>Cheers to an incredible year ahead!</p>
